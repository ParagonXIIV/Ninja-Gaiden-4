# What is this:

    This is a fan made ninja gaiden game made in another engine 
    with all the community likes and wants out of a ninja gaiden game.
    
    This is my attempt at creating a 4th installment in the franchise.
    With hard work I can make this something awesome. But is just a fan
    project not nothing major or big.
    
    
# Platforms:

    Windows 10:
    Others: TBD
    
    
# When will this be done?

    Not sure, my irl keeps me busy so my time is limited.
    Other projects in full race development.
    But will be slow git pushes as of now.
